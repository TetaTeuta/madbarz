# Table of content

Each element has its own scss file and each component can work independetly.

Base file contains major stylings related to body, general layout as well as the breakpoints.

Temps file contains all variables, mixins and layout templates.

## Installation

No installation is required, but the app is designed for mobile devices primaraly so for better experience switch to a mobile view, however, UI should look nice on bigger screens too :)

## Usage

Deployed app: https://tetateuta.github.io/madbarz/

App currently uses dummy data, but there is a React component (feed.js) which is fetching data from API and logging it into a console.
